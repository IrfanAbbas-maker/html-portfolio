<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Irfan Abbas. I am a 24 year old serving as a constable in the Punjab Police. While I am grateful to Almighty Allah for everything I have, I cannot deny that my heart has always longed for something more. Deep inside, I’ve always dreamed of becoming a software engineer. That dream has made me feel like a part of me is missing, and no matter how much I tried, I couldn’t fully satisfy that feeling.</p>
<p>
Recently, I decided to take a bold step toward this dream by starting a web development course, even though I have no degree or prior experience in the field. Every day, I push myself to learn something new, no matter how small. Writing this introduction, for example, is part of a basic web development project but for me, it’s a significant milestone.

<p>
I won’t lie there are moments of doubt. I question myself. Am I wasting my time? Can I really do this? Is it too late for me to start at 24? Will I have the strength to stay consistent? These thoughts sometimes leave me feeling disappointed., but I remind myself of why I started this journey. I want to break the cycle in my family, where the belief is that a government job is the best one can aim for. I want to prove to myself and others that I can achieve more.
</p>
<p>
Whenever hopelessness creeps in, I hold onto my determination and the belief that I can rewrite my story. I’m not just learning web development.I’m chasing a better version of myself, one step at a time. This is my journey, and I’m determined to make it count.
